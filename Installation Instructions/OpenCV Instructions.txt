%%%%%%%%%% Install Instructions for OpenCV 2.4X %%%%%%%%%%
% Download & extract opencv-2.4.10.zip through the file manager or with this command through the terminal:
unzip opencv-2.4.10.zip -d opencv2

% [Optional] Rename opencv-2.4.10.zip iff you didn't use the terminal to unzip
mv opencv-2.4.10 opencv2

cd opencv2 % change directory to opencv2

mkdir build % make new build directory in opencv2 directory  

%%%%%%%%%% Install Instructions for OpenCV 3 %%%%%%%%%%

% I do not currently recommend installing OpenCV3 as it is not in the release stage yet and a lot of functionality is broken and has not been fixed at the time of writing

% Download & extract opencv-3.0.0-beta.zip

% Rename opencv-3.0.0-beta.zip by 
mv opencv-3.0.0-beta.zip opencv3

cd opencv3 % change directory to opencv3

mkdir build % make new build directory in opencv3 directory  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

cd build % change directory to build 

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D BUILD_ZLIB=ON -D BUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON ..

make -j7 % Build by running 7 jobs in parallel

% Go get a cup of tea, this will take a while ...

sudo make install % Actually build it

% If no errors occur you should be successful and have opencv installed

% Test it by opening python and finding which version on opencv is installed

python
import cv2
cv2.__version

% If it says '2.4.X' then you're golden if you installed openCV2
% If it says '3.0.0-beta' then you're golden if you installed openCV3
